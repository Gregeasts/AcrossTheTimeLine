Another key candidate was Zinoviev who was chairman of the comnitern and a member of the politburo and had been high in Lenin's favour (Lenin called him his closest and most trusted assisstant).

It was essential therefore to trigger a chain reaction of other revolutions. However, the revolutions in Germany and Hungary were crushed and defeat in the Russo-Polish war blocked this in the west.

There was a huge crisis in grain procurement in winter 1927 to 1928 with grain purchase by the government 25% down. Low grain prices led to peasant producers concentrating on other goods worth higher prices. The great turn led to the launch of the first five year plan.

Some worried harsh imposition of collectivisation against the kulaks would result in less food being produced. To combat grain procurement, especially in Siberia and the Urals, Stalin went and closed free markets, using the criminal law (article 107) to stop speculation and pressuring local officals to seize grain by force. In 1929 the central committee sent 25000 industrial workers into the countryside to accelerate the development of collective farms.

Stalin wanted tough action to compel peasantry to increase grain supplies while Bukharin was soft on the peasants. Stalin personally supervised stern measures against peasants in Siberia in 1928, not discussing with Bukharin beforehand. Stalin and Bukharin clashed repeatedly in the politburo, however Bukharins speeches made little impact as other members supported Stalin.

By the end of 1929, peasants were being forced into collectives, by local party members and the red army when necessary. Kulaks (roughly 4% of peasant households) were not permitted to join collectives and the Red Army identified, executed and deported these. However, this was not easy and the kulaks were not often identified correctly, with 15% of peasant households destroyed and 150,000 migrating to poorer land. In 1930 Stalin announced that 25% of grain farming areas would be collectivised. By march 1930 58% of peasant households had been collectivised. After this initial success, Stalin briefly made collectivisation voluntary again after saying party members were too confrontational with their methods and collectivisation dropped back down to 20% in October.

All profits were sgared between collective farm members, by the amount of days they had contributed. From 1932 any left over produce was allowed to be sold at a collective farm market, the only free market allowed in the USSR. To bolster collectivisation there was a surge towards mechanisation of farming, including through the creation of machine tractor stations from 1931. However, there was only one machine tractor station for every 40 collectives by 1940, so they were arguably ineffective. In 1938 95% of threshing, 72% of ploughing 57% of spring sowing and 48% of harvesting was done mechanically. However, the rest of the collectives work involved heavy manual labour.

There were also ten year sentences for anyone attempting to sell meat or grain beforw quotas were met.

During the peasant opposition phase of collectivisation, production dropped dramatically, even to 1913 levels. Between 1929-33 25-30% of cattle, pigs and sheep were slaughtered by peasants. Grain output did not exceed pre collectivisation levels until 1935, with it taking until 1953 for livestock numbers to return to what they were before collectivisation.

The Operation Barbarossa was spearheaded by three large armies, one North through the baltic states to Leningrad, one into Ukraine and one thrust towards Moscow. Hitler believed many soviets would welcome the German invaders as liberators from communism. Initially Stalin's response was poor, having a panic attack after the invasion and failing to give any leadership in the first weeks.

Can you name key figures who supported Stalin during this period?", answer: "During 1924-27, Trotsky’s political influence waned, and Stalin increasingly built a personal following. Notably, Stalin secured the loyalty of key figures like Molotov, Kaganovich, and Kirov.

What were the key changes in agricultural and industrial policies, and what was the state of collective farms in 1928?", answer: "The Great Turn in 1927 marked a shift from the NEP to rapid industrialization and forced collectivization. The state aimed to control agriculture through collective farms (kolkhozes) and state farms (sovkhozes). However, by 1928, less than 5% of peasants were working on collective farms. The policy led to a grain procurement crisis, which prompted Stalin to initiate the First Five-Year Plan for industrialization and collectivization.", category: "Economic" },

Between 1925 and 1927, the GMD massacred thousands of striking workers in 1926 in Canton - 30000 at Wuhan in 1927 and suppressed communist uprisings. Despite these actions, Stalin continued to back the GMD, believing their leadership would provide the necessary stability for China, giving military and financial support.

What did the trial highlight about Stalin's approach to opposition?", answer: "The Shakhty Trial of 1928 involved accusations of sabotage against engineers and managers in the Shakhty coal mine. The trial was a public spectacle designed to show Stalin’s power and reinforce his image of combating counterrevolutionary forces. It marked the beginning of widespread purges in Soviet society and served to intimidate those in industry and government who might oppose Stalin’s policies.", category: "Social" },
      { year: "1924-on", question: "What roles did Molotov play in Soviet government from 1924 onwards, and how did his relationship with Stalin affect his political career?", answer: "Molotov joined the Bolsheviks in 1906 and was a key figure in the October Revolution of 1917.

His growing popularity posed a potential threat to Stalin’s leadership, and in 1934, Kirov was assassinated, likely under Stalin’s orders.", category: "Political" },
      { year: 1928, question: "What were the goals of the First Five-Year Plan in 1928, and how did it impact Soviet industry and agriculture? What was the expected increase in production by 1933?", answer: "The First Five-Year Plan, launched in 1928, aimed for a 300% increase in industrial output, focusing on heavy industries such as coal, iron, and steel, boosting production by 300%. It also aimed to electrify the country, increasing electric power by 600% by 1933 (compared to 1928). While the plan prioritized industrial development, it also pushed for rapid collectivization, despite resistance from peasants. This aggressive push for collectivization led to significant social and economic unrest.", category: "Economic" },
      { year: 1929, question: "What happened to Bukharin in 1929, and how did Stalin defeat the Right Opposition? What were the key policy disagreements between Bukharin and Stalin?", answer: "In 1929, Bukharin, the leader of the Right Opposition, was defeated by Stalin, primarily due to disagreements over the NEP and Stalin’s policies toward the peasantry. Bukharin’s more moderate stance on agriculture and his reluctance to enforce collectivization led to his marginalization.

Can you name key figures who were purged or removed from positions?", answer: "The old Bolsheviks who contested for power in the 1920s largely met violent ends, often through Stalin’s purges - only Stalin surviving beyond 1940. Trotsky was exiled in 1929, and figures like Zinoviev, Kamenev, Tomsky, and Bukharin were removed from their positions. Some, like Bukharin, admitted their mistakes in an attempt to regain influence, but Stalin never trusted them. Many were later arrested, executed, or disappeared during the Great Purge of the 1930s.", category: "Political" }
